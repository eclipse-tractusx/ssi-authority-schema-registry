# System Scope and Context

## Business Context

The Authority & Schema Registry is a important component of the Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) ecosystem. It serves the following key business functions:

1. **Identity Authority Management**:
   - The registry acts as the authoritative source for verifying the validity of identity issuers.
   - It maintains a list of approved, trusted identity authorities that can issue verifiable credentials.
   - This ensures trust and reliability in the overall SSI ecosystem.

2. **Credential Schema Management**:
   - The registry stores the standardized schemas for verifiable credentials.
   - It provides a centralized repository of approved credential schemas that can be used by issuers and verifiers.
   - This allows for interoperability and consistency in how credentials are structured and validated across the SSI network.

3. **Discovery and Integration**:
   - The registry acts as a directory, allowing participants to discover approved identity authorities and credential schemas.

From a business perspective, the Authority & Schema Registry is crucial for building trust, interoperability, and compliance within the SSI ecosystem. It provides a foundational layer that allows organizations, governments, and individuals to confidently participate in secure, decentralized identity management.

## Technical Context

From a technical standpoint, the SSI Authority & Schema Registry is built on a foundation that promotes interaction, monitoring, and a host of other functionalities that are crucial for maintaining a secure and reliable identity management system.
