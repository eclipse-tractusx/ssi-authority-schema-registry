## Product Description

The main purpose of the product is to provide the possibility to receive information about available credentials and their authorities. Furthermore, it can validate credential schemas.

The SSI Authority & Schema Registry comprises the technical foundation for functional interaction, monitoring and further functionalities.

The product can be run anywhere: it can be deployed as a docker image, e.g. on Kubernetes (platform-independent, cloud, on prem or local).

The SSI Authority & Schema Registry is using following key frameworks:

- .Net
- Entity Framework
